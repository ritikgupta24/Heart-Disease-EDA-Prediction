#  Heart Disease Prediction (EDA & Visualization)

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visual analytics on a heart disease dataset to better understand patterns in health indicators that may contribute to heart disease â€” with a focus on gender-based trends.

## ðŸ“Š Project Objective

The goal is to uncover insights related to heart disease risks using Python libraries and help visualize trends such as age, cholesterol, blood pressure, and more. This helps in identifying the key health factors contributing to heart disease and how they differ between males and females.
